# Self Driving Car Simulation
I was inspired to do this project by Siraj Raval from Youtube. 

## Overview

In this project I will be using a Neural Network to drive a car around a  track in a simulator. The simulator we're going to use Udacity's [self driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) as a testbed for training an autonomous car. Along with the simulator I was provided a pre-trained model, I will be attempting to outperform this model. 

## Usage
The models that I will be posting can be run by running the command python drive.py "modelname.h5"

## Future Steps:
-Add Lane Detection
-Prevent Swaying

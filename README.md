# Self Driving Car Simulation
I was inspired to do this project by Siraj Raval from Youtube. 

## Overview

In this project I will be using a Neural Network to drive a car around a  track in a simulator. The simulator we're going to use Udacity's [self driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) as a testbed for training an autonomous car. Along with the simulator I was provided a pre-trained model, I will be attempting to outperform this model. 

## Usage
The models that I will be posting can be run by running the command python drive.py "modelname.h5"

## Model Versions
1. *model_Original* - Pre-trained model created
2. *model_V1.00* - Model Trained using 2 Laps of Test data and 2 Epochs
3.	*model_V1.01* - Model Trained using 2 Laps of Test data and 10 Epochs
## Future Steps:
1.	Add Lane Detection
2.	Prevent Swaying
